 For instance, it would be interesting to train an agent to play Mario using Unity Machine Learning agents, 
 (e.g., using this one: https://github.com/linhdvu14/SMB-clone) and create levels that have clearly different amounts of novelty and complexity. 
 You could then have humans play the levels and rate their curiosity towards the game,
 and try to predict that with the self-supervised AI curiosity mechanism implemented in Unity Machine Learning agents. 
The title of the thesis could be “Predicting player curiosity using AI playtesting”
