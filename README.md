# Predicting-player-curiosity-using-AI-playtesting
Master thesis project


For instance, it would be interesting to train an agent to play Mario using Unity Machine Learning agents,
(e.g., using this one: https://github.com/linhdvu14/SMB-clone) and create levels that have clearly different amounts of novelty and complexity. 
You could then have humans play the levels and rate their curiosity towards the game, a
nd try to predict that with the self-supervised AI curiosity mechanism implemented in Unity Machine Learning agents.
The title of the thesis could be “Predicting player curiosity using AI playtesting”


About how to rate human curiosity: There are psychological questionnaires for that, which you should have players answer after each level. The data is noisy, which means we need many players. Thus, best to make a webgl build of the game (easy in Unity) and recruit players to play and answer questions in a browser. You should also read some psychological basics, e.g., https://www.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=hNShDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA157&dq=silvia+curiosity&ots=i7rDh1FFmn&sig=P-OZBnpr496d_UkuMnIzUgBhnTw
