# Predicting-player-curiosity-using-AI-playtesting
Master thesis project


For instance, it would be interesting to train an agent to play Mario using Unity Machine Learning agents,
(e.g., using this one: https://github.com/linhdvu14/SMB-clone) and create levels that have clearly different amounts of novelty and complexity. 
You could then have humans play the levels and rate their curiosity towards the game, a
nd try to predict that with the self-supervised AI curiosity mechanism implemented in Unity Machine Learning agents.
The title of the thesis could be “Predicting player curiosity using AI playtesting”


About how to rate human curiosity: There are psychological questionnaires for that, which you should have players answer after each level. The data is noisy, which means we need many players. Thus, best to make a webgl build of the game (easy in Unity) and recruit players to play and answer questions in a browser. You should also read some psychological basics, e.g., https://www.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=hNShDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA157&dq=silvia+curiosity&ots=i7rDh1FFmn&sig=P-OZBnpr496d_UkuMnIzUgBhnTw

Curiosity is an old, intriguing, and Vexing construct in the psychology of motivation.  

Major strands of thought on curiosity and motivation.
1.curiosity as a motive to reduce negative states, such as unctertainty, novelty, arousal, drive, or information gap
2.curiosity as a source of intrinsic motivation that fosters learning and exploring for their own sake;
3.curiosity as a stable motivational difference between people that leds to differences in knowledge, goals, achievement, and experience.
The scope of psychological thought on curiosity defies a simple integration, but it offers inspiration for researchers curious about why people learn and explore in 
absence of obvious external rewards.


conclusion:
curiosity touches on some of motivational psychology's most vexing problems:
Why do people do something instead of nothing?
Why do people persist with seemingly capricious activities in the absence of obvious external rewards and in the presence of more important gogals?
Why do apparently trivial things capture attention and action?
The wellsprings of action proposed by motivation theories are usually abstract, but the kinds of actions motivated by curiosity is animportant mechanism in the development of knowledge and competence, so it is reassuing that something is coming out of the hours of people exploring their wolds.
